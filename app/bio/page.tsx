      <p>
        I currently work at an investment bank in Salt Lake City, Utah, where I focus on
        full-stack development. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in computer science from the
        University of Southern California, and in my free time, I enjoy working on indie
        projects that let me experiment and stay creative.
